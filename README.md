#hello-world #HI!

My first ever repository

I'm learning html and CSS in a beginning web class, with the goal of creating a little news site that is also visually pleasing.  As I was looking around the internet, I kept stumbling into GitHub... I'm hoping that at some point I'll be competant at jQuery as well as XCode... I want to make little apps.

I'm 28 at this date of creation.
